A Java application that tells you the popularity of your name in your birth year. Using the popularity of your name will then present your potential name if born in a second year of your choice based on the same popularity.

The data used is from the US Social Security website. A link to the link of files is here: https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/names.zip

Primarily this was an exercise for me to learn more about locating and parsing files. I also thought I would play around with Java streams.
